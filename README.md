Decentralized Micro-Task Marketplace

This project is a decentralized micro-task marketplace built on Solidity and deployed on the Etherlink network. It allows users to post and complete small, quick tasks for cryptocurrency rewards.

Features:

Task Creation: Employers can create micro-tasks with detailed descriptions, required skills, and deadlines. Workers can browse available tasks based on categories, skills, or search functionality.
Escrow System: Secure escrow system ensures payment is released only after successful task completion by the worker, verified by the employer.
Reputation System (Optional): Integrates an optional reputation system where employers can rate workers to build trust and incentivize quality work.
Low Fees and Fast Transactions: Leverages Etherlink's low fees and fast transactions for smooth user experience and efficient micro-payments.
Technologies:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS etc.)
Backend: Python (Django, Flask) or Node.js
Smart Contracts: Solidity
